      - "One last glance at our home and the car is already rushing down the highway. – We’re leaving! I am sitting here with mother and 7-year-old cousin Oti; by chance, we managed to hitch a ride in a gasoline car."
      - "The highway is full of refugees, some on foot, and some on horseback, their belongings piled on a cart and a cow tied to the back. There are refugees from Narva and from the surrounding villages, Estonians, Russians, Ingrians! And in the middle of this, the retreating army, military cars, motorcycles, tanks..."
      - "It's impossible to get through! The car has to move together with foot travellers, unable to make room for itself."
      - "Our initial destination – Sooküla – is about 20 kilometres from Narva, near Vaivara. Halfway there, the air fills with a terrible racket. We don't understand the reason for this at first, but then we see a scary image: Russian planes, there may be six or seven of them, are flying over the highway at a low level, shooting at the crowd. In the midst of frantic noise and cries of terror, they keep coming again and again, causing a terrible panic. People and horses are left lying on the road. In the blink of an eye, the crowd, maddened with fear, has thrown themselves down into the roadside ditches. The road is suddenly clear and the car quickly speeds away."

      - "The peace is gone. It is rumoured that the enemy has began an air assault 10-12 kilometres from us. Here, deep in the forest, the rattle of a machine gun echoes so loudly, as if the battle were only a few hundred meters away. Worst of all, it seems to be getting closer by the hour!"
      - "Now, the planes are already flying over here too. The bomb blasts make the house shake and tremble. We are once again in the throes of war."

      - "Finally a chance to leave the countryside behind! We are in the trunk of a car moving towards Jõhvi, planning to continue to Tallinn. It’s a particularly cold evening. The snow shines like silver in the moonlight. Beautiful, so divinely beautiful! But our eyes are blind to this beauty. We only feel that it is cold, terribly cold! Our bones and limbs feel heavy, the wind blows in our hair, and the body seems to be frozen. When, when will we get there?"
      - "We are a link in a long chain of cars. From time to time, the car in front of us suddenly stops due to a malfunction. Our car must also stop, then the one behind us and the whole chain. Another jerk and we stop. The car moving behind us has come too close. Now, unable to brake, it rushes forward..."
      - "We hear a rattle, the glass breaks! We drive on, but the car behind us has stopped, its lamps and windows broken, and it soon disappears behind the curve."
      - "Jõhvi. The lady who was driving with us takes us to her acquaintances. A warm, comfortable, well lit room – we haven't such a thing in weeks! We are given a soft sofa to sleep in. What a pleasure it is to feel comfortable and warm again! It reminds me of home. Dear Narva, will I ever see you again? Can I once again walk on familiar streets, see familiar people again? Grandfather, mother! Where are you now"
      - "I felt my eyes filling with tears and I couldn't stop – I had to cry!"

    - "The fires of war have come terribly close, but half of Narva's population has stubbornly decided to stay put, despite the orders."
    - "What followed was a most horrid night that decided our fate. Already in the evening, cannons were set up in the vicinity of Narva, and by dusk, a commotion broke out. We were utterly in the midst of war. Bullets fly back and forth across the city. The sky is like a sea of fire. It's a beautiful, yet gruesome sight. The explosions of aerial bombs make our house wobble as if it were made of cardboard! Fires will soon break out. In Narva alone, one can count 7-8 fires. We fear the Russians will march in before morning. We decided to leave the next morning before it’s too late. Even so, grandfather and grandmother wish to stay put."
    - "Thus began our war journey."
